# StoryPlayer Android Project

This repository contains an Android application for displaying stories similar to Instagram.

<details><summary><h2> Project Requirements</h2></summary>

Create a UI component which will be a very simple version of Instagramâ€™s Story Player.
The followings are what your module needs to be able to do.
1. Cubic transition among story groups.
2. Pause the story immediately when the users rest and hold, continue when lifted.
3. Go to the previous story and/or story group when users tapped left.
4. Go to the next story and/or story group when users tapped right.
5. Story media could be dummy images and videos on the internet to be downloaded by the player.
6. Duration for images is 5 seconds.
7. Durations for videos are their content length.
8. Each story in a story group should have an individual progress bar on top of the screen which arranges itself according to its duration.
9. While users swiping among story groups, story groups should start from the story they left off unless they are seeing for the first time.
